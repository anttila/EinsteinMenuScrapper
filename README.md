# EinsteinMenuScrapper
A menu scrapper for the local lunch resturant Einstein, creates calendar files for the current menu

# Credits
Original idea for a webscrapper that parses the Einstein menu was from [axhav](https://github.com/axhav/) who has his own project, [lekstuga](https://github.com/axhav/lekstuga). Our projects differ in language and that my project creates calendar files, while his has the option to show images of the food in the menus. But who wants to see images of the food you are about to eat when you can have glorious calendar files instead?
